How to use app:

First you need to download or clone the application from the link I send.

All dependency injection was provided with Maven so it would be good that your system have it installed.
Ofcourse we need IDE too.

Than you need to import the ItemSystem project(i used Eclipse so it's very easy to import using Open Project from file system)

You need to run application thru ItemSystemApplication main class.

I used spring boot, H2 database(In memory not in file this time) and Swagger-UI for your comfort
If your Port is already taken. You should change application.properties file settings(server.port=8080)

When project is running and everyhitng is good you should go to localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to test api crud methods and comment creation
You can also look at localhost:8080/h2 if you want to take a look at the database console.

Thank you for reviewing my task.
